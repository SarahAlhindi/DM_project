## Motivations: 
We are living in the “information age” or rather the “data age”, meaning that everything around us revolves around data. The data has become one of the most valuable assets that a person or an organization can have, Thus, most of the attacks nowadays are directed toward the data. To guard against such damage, organizations have realized the importance of protecting their digital assets, leading them to hire cybersecurity specialists. As a result, the demand for these professionals is higher now than ever before. In order to better understand this field, we decided to analyze a dataset of 1247 cybersecurity employees, containing information such as salary, job title, and experience level. Analyzing this dataset can provide insightful predictions regarding the salary range of cybersecurity employees. Also, the analysis groups cybersecurity employees based on shared characteristics, providing valuable insights for decision-making in the industry.

## Summary

### First steps
1. Define data mining task
2. Read and view dataset
3. Save original dataset
4. Describe dataset and attributes
5. Show sample of the dataset


### Missing values 
In this section we have written codes that aims to find missing values in the dataset. We concluded from the results that we have no missing values or NULLS in all of our attributes.

### Central tendency measures
We summerized our numeric attributes (salary, remote_ratio, salary_in_usd, and work_year) with some statistical measures. i.e: variance, mean, median, quartiles, maximum and minimum. 

### Graph visualization
In the graphs we used the box plot to see the variables distribution. 
We used salary_in_usd with 4 other attribute to see the distribution for each. 
Firstly, We noticed that there is a positive correlation between salaries and the level of experience, meaning that salaries tend to increase as experience levels go up. Secondly, we observed that in 2021, salaries were relatively similar among individuals, but in 2022, we observed a widening gap between them. Turning to employment type Our observation indicates that Full-Time (FT) positions offer higher salaries compared to other categories. Lastly, observation revealed that larger companies tend to offer higher salaries.

### Concept hierarchy generation for nominal data

The columns "company_location" and "employee_residence" have countries names and these attributes can be generalized to higher-level concept that is region to help understand and analyze the dataset better and improve algorithm performance and minimize overfitting.  

We used 7 regions as defined in the World Bank Development Indicators. These regions are:

1. East Asia and Pacific

2. Europe and Central Asia

3. Latin America & Caribbean

4. Middle East and North Africa

5. North America

6. South Asia

7. Sub-Saharan Africa

Note: UM (The United States Minor Outlying Islands) and AQ(Antarctica) don't belong to any of these regions, thus, they will be used as they are.


We have done Concept hierarchy generation for "job_title" as well to improve interpretation and scalability. Also, most job titles are essentially the same job but with different names, so we combined them into higher-level jobs titles. These titles are:

1.	Analyst
2.	Engineer
3.	Architect
4.	Manager
5.	Specialist
6.	Tester
7.	Lead
8.	Officer
9.	Researcher
10.	Consultant
11.	Other


### Encoding categorical data  
To deal with columns with character type we have encoded them, because most machine learning algorithms are designed to work with factors data rather than character data and it improves performance and Interpretability of data as well.

These columns are:
1.	experience_level
2.	employment_type
3.	employee_residence
4.	company_location
5.	salary_currency
6.	job_title
7.	company_size

For example, experience_level has become a factor with 4 levels,
1.	EN(Entry-level)
2.	MI(Mid level)
3.	SE(Senior level)
4.	EX(Executive level)


### Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
We excluded the salary and employment type columns from the model duo to redundancies and low variance. This leaves these columns to predict the salary_in_usd:
1. work_year
2. experience_level
3. job_title
4. salary_currency
5. employee_residence
6. remote ratio
7. company_location
8. company_size

### Finding and removing outliers
Through creating a box plot to visualize outliers for numeric attributes (remote_ratio, salary_in_usd, and work_year) then removing them to minimize noise and to get better analytical results when applying data mining techniques.
We noticed that remote_ratio and work_year have no outliers , while salary_in_usd have many exceptionally high values.


### Discretization  
We have divided the range of salary_in_usd into continuous intervals labeled and organized as concepts, to enhance interpretability and possibly avoid overfitting. 
1.	Very Low,
2.	Low
3.	High
4.	Very High
Now we can classify the employees’ salary into these intervals.


### Normalization  

The attributes that are numeric of the remaining attributes are work_year and remote_ratio, but these two have different scales, and to avoid giving one attribute greater weight, we must normalize them. We used Z-scaling to normalize them.
