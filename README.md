## Motivations: 
We are living in the “information age” or rather the “data age”, meaning that everything around us revolves around data. The data has become one of the most valuable assets that a person or an organization can have, Thus, most of the attacks nowadays are directed toward the data. To guard against such damage, organizations have realized the importance of protecting their digital assets, leading them to hire cybersecurity specialists. As a result, the demand for these professionals is higher now than ever before. In order to better understand this field, we decided to analyze a dataset of 1247 cybersecurity employees, containing information such as salary, job title, and experience level. Analyzing this dataset can provide insightful predictions regarding the salary range of cybersecurity employees.
