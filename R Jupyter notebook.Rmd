### Problem

We are living in the "information age" or rather the "data age", 
meaning that everything around us revolves around data. 
The data has become one of the most valuable assets that a person 
or an organisation can have, since it has a significant value,
losing it will lead to significant damages. Thus, most of the 
attacks nowadays are directed toward the data. To guard against
such damages, organisations have realised the importance of protecting
their digital assets, leading them to hire cybersecurity specialists. 
This made cybersecurity gain popularity
among people so there's a growing tendency to study cybersecurity.
Consequently this resulted in the emergence of plentiful professionals
with various experience levels and skills in this field. As a result, 
organisations may find it difficult to decide a salary for job candidates
solely based on the CV. also, since the attacks improve rapidly,
organisations need to hire more employees in the far future to defend 
against such attacks but it's not an easy matter to predict the future
payroll which may hinders some of the organisation's plans. Another issue 
arises when the decision makers in the organisation aren't fully aware of 
the trends on salary. Their lack of awareness gives a chance for the competitor
organisations to attract their employees to them by offering a better salary that match current trends

### Goal

##f Given the problems we discussed and In order to better understand this field,
we decided to analyse a dataset of 1247 cybersecurity employees, containing
information such as salary, job title, and experience level. Analysing this 
dataset can provide insightful predictions regarding the salary range of a cybersecurity employee,
which can help in

-   Making better decisions
-   Making recruitment and hiring process easier and more efficient
-   Predicting the future payroll
-   Increasing loyalty
-   Increasing the satisfaction rate
-   Achieving fairness
