### Problem statement

Prediction of cyber security employees' salaries based on 11 attributes

1.work_year

2.experience_level

3.employment_type

4.job_title

5.salary

6.salary_currency

7.salary_in_usd

8.employee_residence

9.remote_ratio

10.company_location

11.company_size

### Problem description

We are living in the "information age" or rather the "data age", meaning that everything around us revolves around data. The data has become one of the most valuable assets that a person or an organisation can have, since it has a significant value, losing it will lead to significant damages. Thus, most of the attacks nowadays are directed toward the data. To guard against such damages, organisations have realised the importance of protecting their digital assets, leading them to hire cybersecurity specialists. This made cybersecurity gain popularity among people so there's a growing tendency to study cybersecurity. Consequently this resulted in the emergence of plentiful professionals with various experience levels and skills in this field. As a result, organisations may find it difficult to decide a salary for job candidates solely based on the CV. also, since the attacks improve rapidly, organisations need to hire more employees in the far future to defend against such attacks but it's not an easy matter to predict the future payroll which may hinders some of the organisation's plans. Another issue arises when the decision makers in the organisation aren't fully aware of the trends on salary. Their lack of awareness gives a chance for the competitor organisations to attract their employees to them by offering a better salary that match current trends


### Data mining task

Prediction of the cyber security employees' salaries using regression

### Goal

Given the problems we discussed and In order to better understand this field, we decided to analyse a dataset of 1247 cybersecurity employees, containing information such as salary, job title, and experience level. Analysing this dataset can provide insightful predictions regarding the salary range of a cybersecurity employee, which can help in

-   Making better decisions
-   Making recruitment and hiring process easier and more efficient
-   Predicting the future payroll
-   Increasing loyalty
-   Increasing the satisfaction rate
-   Achieving fairness

We observed that the larger the company is the higher the salary was.


## Data Reduction  
### Dimensionality Reduction 


The "salary" column gives the same information as "salary_in_usd" it's just a matter of currency exchange, and we will eventually transform all the values in "salary" column 
to one common currency so we can properly deal with them. To further confirm that the two column are redundant, we will use the latest exchange rate for USD to the desired currency.

we will start by creating a temporary column named "converted_salary" to save the salary that we will get by using the exchange rate to convert the salary_in_usd to the salary with different currencies to compare with "salary" column


```{r}
convertedDataset=dataset


convertedDataset$exchange_rate = factor(convertedDataset$salary_currency, levels=c("USD","BRL","GBP","EUR","INR","CAD","CHF","DKK","SGD","AUD","SEK","MXN","ILS","PLN","NOK","IDR","NZD","HUF","ZAR","TWD","RUB"), labels=c(1/1,1/0.20,1/1.22,1/1.06,1/0.012,1/0.74,1/1.10,1/0.14,1/0.73,1/0.64,1/0.090,1/0.057,1/0.26,1/0.23,1/0.093,1/0.000065,1/0.60,1/0.0027,1/0.053,1/0.031,1/0.010))
convertedDataset$exchange_rate = as.numeric(as.character(convertedDataset$exchange_rate))
convertedDataset$converted_salary = convertedDataset$salary_in_usd*convertedDataset$exchange_rate



set.seed(1)
salary_sample <- sample_n(convertedDataset[,c("salary","converted_salary")],10)

print(salary_sample)
```


as shown in the sample, the two columns are almost identical. This can be proved by correlation coefficient as well.



```{r}
correlation <- cor(convertedDataset$salary , convertedDataset$converted_salary)
print(correlation)
```
It hasn't reached 100% possibly due to rounding in the calculations and slight differences in the exchange rate over time.  

To make the mining process more effiecent and has an improved quality, we decided to remove the "salary" column.
