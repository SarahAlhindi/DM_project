2.experience_level

3.employment_type

4.job_title

5.salary

### Problem description

We are living in the "information age" or rather the "data age", meaning that everything around us revolves around data. The data has become one of the most valuable assets that a person or an organisation can have, since it has a significant value, losing it will lead to significant damages. Thus, most of the attacks nowadays are directed toward the data. To guard against such damages, organisations have realised the importance of protecting their digital assets, leading them to hire cybersecurity specialists. This made cybersecurity gain popularity among people so there's a growing tendency to study cybersecurity. Consequently this resulted in the emergence of plentiful professionals with various experience levels and skills in this field. As a result, organisations may find it difficult to decide a salary for job candidates solely based on the CV. also, since the attacks improve rapidly, organisations need to hire more employees in the far future to defend against such attacks but it's not an easy matter to predict the future payroll which may hinders some of the organisation's plans. Another issue arises when the decision makers in the organisation aren't fully aware of the trends on salary. Their lack of awareness gives a chance for the competitor organisations to attract their employees to them by offering a better salary that match current trends

### Data mining task

Prediction of the cyber security employees' salary categories (Very Low, Low, , High, Very High) using classification methods.

### Goal

Given the problems we discussed and In order to better understand this field, we decided to analyse a dataset of 1247 cybersecurity employees, containing information such as salary, job title, and experience level. Analysing this dataset can provide insightful predictions regarding the salary range of a cybersecurity employee, which can help in

-   Making better decisions
-   Making recruitment and hiring process easier and more efficient
-   Predicting the future payroll
-   Increasing loyalty
-   Increasing the satisfaction rate
-   Achieving fairness

# phase 2

### sample of 20 employees from the dataset:

using sample_n(table,size) function and using (set_seed())

```{r}
set.seed(30)
sample=sample_n(dataset,20)
print(sample)
```

### Show the missing value:

if it is FALSE it means no null value,if it is TRUE there is null value. In our dataset there is no null values.

```{r}
is.na(dataset)
sum(is.na(dataset))
```

### Show the Min.,1st Qu.,Median,Mean ,3rd Qu.,Max. for each numeric column

```{r}
summary(dataset$work_year)
summary(dataset$salary)
summary(dataset$salary_in_usd)
summary(dataset$remote_ratio)
```

### Show the variane of each numeric column

```{r}
var(dataset$work_year)
var(dataset$salary)
var(dataset$salary_in_usd)
var(dataset$remote_ratio)
```





### Visualization of relationship between some pairs of attributes:

Here we used boxplot to see the distribution between salary_in_usd and experience_level We observed that salaries vary depending on the level of experience,they are positively correlated.

```{r}
boxplot(salary_in_usd ~ experience_level, data = dataset , yaxt="n")
labels<- pretty(dataset$salary_in_usd)
labels<- sapply(labels, function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE))
axis(side = 2, at=pretty(dataset$salary_in_usd), labels = labels )
options(scipen = 999)
```

Here we used boxplot to see the distribution between salary_in_usd and work_year We observed that 2021 salaries were close to each other but in 2022 the gap between them getting bigger.

```{r}
boxplot(salary_in_usd ~ work_year, data = dataset , yaxt="n")
labels<- pretty(dataset$salary_in_usd)
labels<- sapply(labels, function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE))
axis(side = 2, at=pretty(dataset$salary_in_usd), labels = labels )
options(scipen = 999)
```

Here we used boxplot to see the distribution between salary_in_usd and employment_type We observed that Full Time (FT) offers more salary than the other categories.

```{r}
boxplot(salary_in_usd ~ employment_type, data = dataset , yaxt="n")
labels<- pretty(dataset$salary_in_usd)
labels<- sapply(labels, function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE))
axis(side = 2, at=pretty(dataset$salary_in_usd), labels = labels )
options(scipen = 999)
```

Here we used boxplot to see the distribution between salary_in_usd and company_size We observed that the larger the company is the higher the salary was.

```{r}
boxplot(salary_in_usd ~ company_size, data = dataset , yaxt="n")
labels<- pretty(dataset$salary_in_usd)
labels<- sapply(labels, function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE))
axis(side = 2, at=pretty(dataset$salary_in_usd), labels = labels )
options(scipen = 999) 
```

## Data Reduction

### Dimensionality Reduction

The "salary" column gives the same information as "salary_in_usd" it's just a matter of currency exchange, and we will eventually transform all the values in "salary" column to one common currency so we can properly deal with them. To further confirm that the two column are redundant, we will use the latest exchange rate for USD to the desired currency.

we will start by creating a temporary column named "converted_salary" to save the salary that we will get by using the exchange rate to convert the salary_in_usd to the salary with different currencies to compare with "salary" column

```{r}
convertedDataset=dataset


convertedDataset$exchange_rate = factor(convertedDataset$salary_currency, levels=c("USD","BRL","GBP","EUR","INR","CAD","CHF","DKK","SGD","AUD","SEK","MXN","ILS","PLN","NOK","IDR","NZD","HUF","ZAR","TWD","RUB"), labels=c(1/1,1/0.20,1/1.22,1/1.06,1/0.012,1/0.74,1/1.10,1/0.14,1/0.73,1/0.64,1/0.090,1/0.057,1/0.26,1/0.23,1/0.093,1/0.000065,1/0.60,1/0.0027,1/0.053,1/0.031,1/0.010))
convertedDataset$exchange_rate = as.numeric(as.character(convertedDataset$exchange_rate))
convertedDataset$converted_salary = convertedDataset$salary_in_usd*convertedDataset$exchange_rate



set.seed(1)
salary_sample <- sample_n(convertedDataset[,c("salary","converted_salary")],10)

print(salary_sample)
```

as shown in the sample, the two columns are almost identical. This can be proved by correlation coefficient as well.

```{r}
correlation <- cor(convertedDataset$salary , convertedDataset$converted_salary)
print(correlation)
```

The correlation is so high but it hasn't reached 100% possibly due to rounding in the calculations and slight differences in the exchange rate over time.

To make the mining process more effiecent and has an improved quality, we decided to remove the "salary" column.

```{r}
dataset<-dataset[,-c(5)]
```


### Find the outliers and remove them:
We will show outliers with boxPlots and then remove them, to minimize noise and to get better analytical results when applying data mining techniques.

now we show (salary_in_usd) attributes' outliers.
we can see that there are many outliers with exceptionally high values, thus we will remove them.
```{r}
boxplot(dataset$salary_in_usd)



OutSalary = outlier(dataset$salary_in_usd, logical =TRUE)
Find_outlier = which(OutSalary ==TRUE, arr.ind = TRUE)
dataset= dataset[-Find_outlier,]

```

now we show (remote_ratio) attributes' outliers.
we can see there aren't outliers in remote_ratio, thus we don't need the last step i.e: removing outliers' rows.
```{r}
boxplot(dataset$remote_ratio)

```

now we show (work_year) attributes' outliers.
we can see there aren't outliers in work_year, thus we don't need the last step i.e: removing outliers' rows.
```{r}
boxplot(dataset$work_year)

```




### Concept hierarchy generation for nominal data

the columns "company_location" and "employee_residence" have the name of countries for the company and employee respectively. And these attributes can be generalized to higher-level concept that is region to help understand and analyze the dataset better and improve algorithm performance.

We will use the 7 regions as defined in the World Bank Development Indicators. These regions are:

1.  East Asia and Pacific: This region includes countries like China, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.

2.  Europe and Central Asia: This region includes countries like Germany, UK, Russia, Turkey, etc.

3.  Latin America & Caribbean: This region includes countries like Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Cuba, etc.

4.  Middle East and North Africa: This region includes countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, etc.

5.  North America: This is predominantly United States and Canada.

6.  South Asia: This region includes countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc.

7.  Sub-Saharan Africa: This region includes countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.

Note: UM(The United States Minor Outlying Islands) and AQ(Antarctica) don't belong to any of these regions, thus, they will be used as they are.

```{r}


um=which(dataset$company_location=="UM")
aq=which(dataset$company_location=="AQ")


dataset$company_location <- countrycode(dataset$company_location, "iso2c", "region")
dataset$employee_residence <- countrycode(dataset$employee_residence, "iso2c", "region")

dataset[um,"company_location"]="UM"
dataset[aq,"company_location"]="AQ"

```

Concept hierarchy generation can be done for "job_title" as well to improve interpretation and scalability. Also, most job titles are essentially the same job but with different names, so we can combine them into a higher-level jobs titles such as Architect, Analyst and Engineer etc.



```{r}
## Create the categories based on job rank 
dataset$job_title <- ifelse(grepl("Analyst", dataset$job_title), "Analyst",
                                ifelse(grepl("Architect", dataset$job_title), "Architect",
                                       ifelse(grepl("Engineer", dataset$job_title), "Engineer",
                                              ifelse(grepl("Manager|Officer|Director|Leader", dataset$job_title), "Leadership",
                                                     ifelse(grepl("Consultant|Specialist", dataset$job_title), "Consultant/Specialist",
                                                            ifelse(grepl("Cyber", dataset$job_title), "Cyber Security",
                                                                   "Others"))))))

```






## Encoding categorical data

To deal with columns with character type we are going to encode them, because most machine learning algorithms are designed to work with factors data rather than character data and it improves performance and Interpretability of data as well.

```{r}
dataset$job_title  <- factor(dataset$job_title)

dataset$experience_level = factor(dataset$experience_level, levels=c("EN", "MI", "SE", "EX"), labels=c(1,2,3,4))

dataset$employment_type  <- factor(dataset$employment_type)

dataset$employee_residence  <- factor(dataset$employee_residence)

dataset$company_location  <- factor(dataset$company_location)

dataset$salary_currency  <- factor(dataset$salary_currency)

dataset$job_title  <- factor(dataset$job_title)


dataset$company_size = factor(dataset$company_size, levels=c("S","M","L"), labels=c(1,2,3))


dataset$job_title  <- factor(dataset$job_title)

```

### Discretization of salaray_in_usd attribute

by calculating breaks based on quartiles

```{r}
breaks <- quantile(dataset$salary_in_usd, 
                   probs = c(0, .25, .5, .75, .95, 1), 
                   na.rm = TRUE)


dataset$salary_in_usd <- cut(dataset$salary_in_usd, 
                                       breaks = breaks, 
                                       include.lowest = TRUE, 
                                       labels=c("Very Low", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High"))


```

### Normalization:

to change the scale of numeric attributes (remote_ratio and work_year) to a scale of [-1,1] to give them equal weight

```{r}
dataset [, c("work_year" , "remote_ratio")] = scale(dataset [, c("work_year" , "remote_ratio")])
```




## Feature Selection

we will implement feature selection to remove redundant or irrelevant attributes from the data set to get the smallest subset that can help us get the most accurate predictions for our target class(salary_in_usd) and decrease the time that it takes the classifier to process the data.  

we will use RFE(Recursive feature elimination) which is a wrapper method for the feature selection. Since the RFE function have multiple control options we need to specify the options that we want. We will choose "Random Forest" because it has high accuracy, can handle categorical data.  


```{r}
control <- rfeControl(functions = rfFuncs, 
                      method = "repeatedcv",
                      repeats = 5, 
                      number = 10)
```


First we save the features to be used in the feature selection(every attributes except the class label "salary_in_usd") in variable x, and the class label in variable y. Then split the data to 80% training and 20% test.


```{r}
x <- dataset %>%
  select(-salary_in_usd) %>%
  as.data.frame()

# Target variable
y <- dataset$salary_in_usd

# Training: 80%; Test: 20%
set.seed(2021)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y, p = .80, list = FALSE)[,1]

x_train <- x[ inTrain, ]
x_test  <- x[-inTrain, ]

y_train <- y[ inTrain]
y_test  <- y[-inTrain]

```

after splitting the data, now we can perform the selection using rfe


```{r}
set.seed(1)
result_rfe1 <- rfe(x = x_train, 
                   y = y_train, 
                   sizes = c(1:9),
                   rfeControl = control)

result_rfe1

predictors(result_rfe1)

```


The results show that all the remaining attributes, except for "employment_type", are selected. This is logical, as 98% of the rows have the value "FT", as shown in the table below. Due to the low variance, we decided to remove this attribute.

```{r}
table(dataset$employment_type)
```

```{r}
dataset<-dataset[,-which(names(dataset)=="employment_type")]
```

# phase 3

## Clustering
Firstly, we will decide the number of clusters, we will use different methods to obtain 3 different number of cluster 

### Empirical method
which obtains approximate the number of clusters according to a mathematical formula
```{r}
# n=No. of objects in the dataset
n <- nrow(dataset)


#Empirical method formula
num_clusters <- sqrt(n / 2)


#Round the number of clusters to the nearest integer
num_clusters <- round(num_clusters)


# Print number of clusters
print(num_clusters)

```

so, we obtained the first number of clusters which equals 24, significantly this number is large, now let's try another method
